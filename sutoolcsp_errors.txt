To get an idea of the kind of error/warning messages you will see.

Run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xallERRORS.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2xallERRORS2.txt


Note that fldr 9 has 4 segments specifying channels 1-12 11-22 25-36 37-48.
This means channels 11 and 12 are defined to exist twice in the layout for fldr 9.

Similarly, fldr 10 has 4 segments specifying channels 1-12 13-24 22-34 37-48.
This means channels 22 and 23 are defined to exist twice in the layout for fldr 10.


This will cause error messages, and also some related warning messages.
