To get a quick idea of what is going on here, first view:

  shots.png 
  receiver.png

One thing to note is that the shot lines and receiver lines are at right-angles. 
This is quite typical for 3D (for 2D the shot line is the same as the receiver line).
Another confusion is that points may be named "stations" in some documents. 

Next: view file shotshot.svg which contains an image of the top part of an SPS2 S-file and also 
the top part of the corresponding csv file after conversion to csv by SUTOOLCSV and then importing
that csv file to libreOffice Calc. In the rest of this document the csv files are converted back 
to fixed-format. But that is not needed for SUGEOMCSV which can perform updates to SU seismic files 
using either csv or fixed-format.

Yes, I could automate all examples if the idea here was to test my code, but it isn't.  
The idea is to show novice users how to proceed. 

First test:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2xall2.csv

Now look at the output l2xall2.csv in a simple text editor (like "vi"). 

Now run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall2.csv wfile=l2xall2.txt

This converts the csv back to fixed format. Look at the output l2xall2.txt file.

And/or Run:

  diff l2xall2.txt l2xall.txt

Notice that the data records are identical.  

Now go back to the l2xall2.csv file and put a 3 where the second 0 is located:
        that is, change     C_SU_ID,%.0f,%.0f... to  C_SU_ID,%.0f,%.3f...


Rerun:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall2.csv wfile=l2xall2.txt

Note that the top "7" value has become "7.000" (and so on for that "column" of numbers). 


Next, change the 18_grnofr_27 to 18_grnofr_25 in the l2xall2.csv file.

Rerun:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall2.csv wfile=l2xall2.txt

Note that the "100.00" on first data record has moved 2 spaces to the left (and so on for that "column" of numbers).

----

You can run the same kinds of tests for the SPS2 S and R files:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2sall.txt setid=s match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2sall2.csv
  sutoolcsv rfile=l2sall2.csv wfile=l2sall2.txt
  diff l2sall2.txt l2sall.txt
  
  sutoolcsv rfile=l2rall.txt setid=r match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2rall2.csv
  sutoolcsv rfile=l2rall2.csv wfile=l2rall2.txt
  diff l2rall2.txt l2rall.txt
