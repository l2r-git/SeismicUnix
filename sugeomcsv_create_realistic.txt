 
This is how I created the datasets I used in my tests:
(except change the create=100 to create=all in next line) 

  sugeomcsv rfile=l2xall.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2 >fakex.su create=100 spikes=4,0.01,200,1000,208,1200,500,-2000,800,1600,1000,0

  sugeomcsv rfile=l2sall.txt setid=s match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2 <fakex.su >fakexs.su

  sugeomcsv rfile=l2rall.txt setid=r match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2 <fakexs.su >fakexsr.su
  
  subfilt <fakexsr.su >fakexsrf.su fpasshi=20

  sunmo <fakexsrf.su >fakexsrfn.su invert=1 tnmo=0,190,450,800 vnmo=1800,3500,4000,5000

--------

The filter and inverse NMO give some nice "horizons", which you can see:

  suximage <fakexsrfn.su

--------

Even more realistic would be to put a linear horizon on to make a refraction first break, 
but I could not immediately see how to do that easily.

Tests of surface-consistent residual statics programs would be easy with this dataset
(just apply the negative of the static values). 
Also easy to test surface-consistant amplitude compensation and surface-consistant de-signature 
and deconvolution (just apply some different ones for selected shot gathers and receiver gathers,
and the programs should find the inverse).

But I digress.

--------

In order not to fool myself, I then zeroed many of the key values within the fake datasets:

sugeomcsv rfile=l2z.csv setid=z match=igi names=c_su_id,igi,grnofr,grnlof,grnors,gaps,sstat,sdel,sut,swdep,sx,sy,selev,gstat,gdel,gut,gwdep,gx,gy,gelev,offset,cdp <fakexsrfn.su >fakexsrfnz.su

Note that I use match=igi because I know that igi still contains 0 in headers.
