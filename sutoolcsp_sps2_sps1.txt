How to convert from sps2 to sps1 and vice-versa.

Remember back in sutoolcsp_example1.txt you did this:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2xall2.csv

And then:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall2.csv wfile=l2xall2.txt

This converted the SPS2 fixed format X file to csv and then back to SPS2 fixed format.

This happened because the second run of sutoolcsv used the C_SU records at the top of the csv file.
But notice that those C_SU records do not contain any explicit reference to SPS2. 
When it converted back, sutoolcsv simply followed the instructions within the C_SU records.

So, instead of converting back to SPS2, you can convert back to SPS1.

Run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xall2.csv setid=x match=sps1 forms=sps1 names=sps1all wfile=l1xall.txt

Look at the output l1xall.txt which is now in sps1 format. 
This works because the names=sps2all and names=sps1all options make the same number
of fields in the same order (and using the same SU key names of course).
This functions for S and R type files as well. 
But the names=sps2 and names=sps1 options do NOT have the same number of fields. You need sps2all and sps1all.

The conversion from SPS1 to SPS2 also works. But the SPS1 format allows characters in
line names and so on, and may require process= options before this will give acceptable results.
See sutoolcsp_process.txt for how to use process= options.

----

Converting from SPS2 to SPS1 or vice-versa is an example of a generic functionality.
In the output csv files above you should notice that the specific forms and names exist in 
the same column as their data values (in a SpreadSheet or csv editor). 
By altering the forms or names, you can change the output format of the numbers as well as 
their card-column locations. You can also change the name of the SU key associated
with the values, or use "numb1,numb2,..." as the names. This allows you to manipulate
fixed format and csv files which have nothing to do with seismic or geophysics.
