To get an idea of what the process options do,

Run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l1xPROCESS.txt setid=x match=sps1 forms=sps1 names=sps1all wfile=l1xP.txt

Note several field-unreadable errors/warnings occur.
Look at the input l1xPROCESS.txt file card-columns. You can see that it is SPS1 format. 
A basic problem with SPS1 files is that the shot lines and receiver lines often contain characters.

Now run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l1xPROCESS.txt setid=x match=sps1 forms=sps1 names=sps1all wfile=l1xP.txt process=14_trimz_29

Note that the error field-unreadable as a number (         S100A2 ) is gone.
Look at the output l1xP.txt file. The S100A2 has been replaced with 10002.


So, try a similar thing for the R-500100 error/warning. 

Now run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l1xPROCESS.txt setid=x match=sps1 forms=sps1 names=sps1all wfile=l1xP.txt 
            process=14_trimz_29,48_trimz_63

The R-500100 has been replaced with -500100 but now there are other error/warnings that -500100 
is too large to fit in the SU name. The SU name for this field is grnors (set by names=sps1 option).
The grnors SU key is a 2-byte integer which means only magnitudes less than 32765 can fit.  

So run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l1xPROCESS.txt setid=x match=sps1 forms=sps1 names=sps1all wfile=l1xP.txt 
            process=14_trimz_29,48_trimz_63,48_mul_-1_63,48_sub_500000_63

Now look at the output l1xP.txt file and see that R-500100 has now been reduced to 100.

Is this kind of processing OK? Generally yes. Remember that SUGEOMCSV is updating all these
values into the SU trace headers. So it "does not matter" what the original field numbering is.
But you should try to retain as much of the original numbering as possible so that you can 
still identify which field lines your new numbers refer to.

You will, of course, need to perform similar process= options for the S and R files to reduce
their line numbers the same way as for this X file.  

Similar process= options may need to be done for shot and/or receiver point numbers.
(Acquisition surveyors loved to put weird characters and unnecessarily large numbers in SPS1 files). 

You can, of course, use process= options just to convert S and R files from feet to metres. 

But you can also just convert the input file to csv and then read that csv file into a SpreadSheet
(libreOffice Calc or whatever) and change the values. As long as you do not mangle the C_SU records
at the top, you can then convert back to txt if you want.

*****

Note: SUGEOMCSV does not have process= options. That is deliberate. 
      You need to review the process= effects and input the changed files to SUGEOMCSV.
