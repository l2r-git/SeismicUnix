To get an idea of what the unrepeat option does,

Run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xallFLDR_RESET.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2xallF2.txt

Note that the fldr values in l2xallFLDR_RESET.txt are 7,8,9,7,8,9,10, and 11 
which means the field people chose to re-start fldr numbering at 7. 
This kind of thing often happens (but usually after many more records).  

Within sutoolcsv and sugeomcsv, all records for each fldr are considered a set, regardless of their order.
Which means fldr 7 appears to have 8 segments with overlapping channel ranges, so you get the same kinds 
of errors/warnings as in sutoolcsp_errors.txt 

Run:

  sutoolcsv rfile=l2xallFLDR_RESET.txt setid=x match=sps2 forms=sps2 names=sps2all wfile=l2xallF2.txt unrepeat=1

The unrepeat option can often solve this issue. But it is not foolproof. Sometimes you will simply have to
edit the SPS2 X-file and the seismic file into separate (unique fldr) pieces before running sugeomcsv.
